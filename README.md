# Victorian Building Generator

A Blender script for generating buildings in the style of late Victorian rural England, using Chat GPT extensively.

## Getting Started

To use the Victorian Building Generator, you will need to have Blender installed on your computer. You can download Blender for free from the [official website](https://www.blender.org/download/).

Once you have Blender installed, you can clone this repository and open the `sample.blend` file in Blender. The script is located in the `op.py` file and can be run by pressing `Run Script` in the Text Editor.

## Usage

To generate a building, run the `Generate Building` operator in the 3D Viewport. This will generate a building in the style of late Victorian rural England. The generated building will be selected by default, and you can use the standard Blender tools to modify it as desired.
